        <h1>King Arthur - The Legend</h1>
        <p><b>Arthur</b> was the first born son of King Uther Pendragon and heir to ther throne.
        However these are a very troubled times dan <b>Merlin</b>, a wise magician, advised that
        the baby Arthur should be raised in a secret place and that none should know his
        true identitiy.<br>As Merlin feared, when King Uther died there will be a great
        conflict over the throne. So, Merlin used his magic to set a sword in a stone.
        Written on the sword, in letters of gold, were the words:"Whose able to pull out
        this sword from this stone is the rightwise born king of all England."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Of course all the contenders for the throne took their turn at trying to draw 
        the sword, but none could succeed. Arthur, quite by chance, withdrew the sword 
        for another to use in a tournament. Following this he became King.</p>
