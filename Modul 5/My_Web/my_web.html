            <img id="gambar1" src="lion_1.jpg">
            <p><b>Lion</b>, (<i>Panthera leo</i>), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that 
            is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion 
            has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are 
            most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, 
            savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much 
            of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa 
            south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute 
            a slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India’s Gir 
            National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.</p>

            <p>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. 
            Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male’s outstanding 
            characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and 
            populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be 
            full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and 
            continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some 
            lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic 
            appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or 
            impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) 
            long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder 
            and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with 
            a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 
            120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, 
            orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is 
            usually darker than the rest of the coat.</p>

            <p>Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents and baboons 
            to Cape (or African) buffalo and hippopotamuses, but they predominantly hunt medium- 
            to large-sized hoofed animals such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. Prey 
            preferences vary geographically as well as between neighbouring prides. Lions are 
            known to take elephants and giraffes, but only if the individual is young or especially 
            sick. They readily eat any meat they can find, including carrion and fresh kills 
            that they scavenge or forcefully steal from hyenas, cheetahs, or wild dogs. Lionesses 
            living in open savanna do most of the hunting, whereas males typically appropriate 
            their meals from the female’s kills. However, male lions are also adept hunters, and 
            in some areas they hunt frequently. Pride males in scrub or wooded habitat spend less 
            time with the females and hunt most of their own meals. Nomadic males must always secure 
            their own food.</p>
